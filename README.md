## Introduction

Laravel Socialite provides an expressive, fluent interface to OAuth authentication with Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub,Laravel Passport, GitLab and Bitbucket. It handles almost all of the boilerplate social authentication code you are dreading writing.


Adapters for other platforms are listed at the community driven [Socialite Providers](https://socialiteproviders.github.io/) website. Thank you for team Socialite
